（1）Since the latest version FEALPY 3.0 is not compatible with the FEALPY 2.0 used in this paper, please use the FEALPY 2.0 installation package.

（2）Installation URL: https://blog.csdn.net/qq_47925836/article/details/124627258. Furthermore, we kindly refer the reviewer to  the corresponding finite element  package `FEALPY` as specified in reference [34].

（3）We recommend using PyCharm to run the computational program ‘High_Re_variable_step_PC_BDF2_Scheme.py’provided in the attachment.

（4）In the computational program, the numerical errors of the PC-BDF2 scheme can be obtained by adjusting the parameters ‘nu’ (viscosity coefficient), ‘nx’ (number of spatial mesh nodes), and ‘kappa’ (stabilization parameter).
